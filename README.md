# Air-Hockey-AI
A reinforcement learning agent trained to play air hockey, made using the Unity ML-Agents toolkit!  
Try to beat the AI yourself here: https://edz123.itch.io/air-hockey-ai  
(I've managed to score against it once or twice, so it's probably possible to win)

## How to Play
- Drag your mouse to control your paddle
- Press "play" to play against the AI yourself
- Press "simulation" to run a simulation of the AI playing against itself
